Ireland has a severe housing crisis with the average rent exceeding 2000 EUR a month, the equivalent to the entire monthly take-home pay of a newly quialified teacher. The rent burden forces many of the young into shared living. Many pay as much as half of their salary for a small room in the capital.

This repo archives rent price in Dublin for a room in shared living.

Data on shared rooms is collected on a daily basis from Daft.ie, the most popular website for renting in Ireland.
